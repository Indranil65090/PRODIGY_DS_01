# PRODIGY_DS_01

This project contains histogram and bar chart to visualize the distribution of either a continuous or categorical variable in a dataset.
The objective here is to offer a clear depiction of frequency of different values in the categorical variable such as age.

DATA VISUALIZATION

Utilizing a library like matplotlib or seaborn in Python, the code generates a bar chart for categorical variables or a histogram for continuous variables. This visual representation provides insights into the distribution and relative frequencies of different values within the chosen variable.
